<p id="reason">
    The page at <a href="{{ task.url }}">{% include 'SimplyTestableWebClientBundle:Partials:/url/utf8-raw-possibly-truncated-64.html.twig' with {'url': task_url} %}</a> does not have a document type.
</p>

<p>
    There are many versions of HTML and in order to check
    if your document is valid we need to know what
    version of HTML you are using.

<p>
    Have a look at <a href="http://www.w3.org/QA/2002/04/valid-dtd-list.html">recommended doctype declarations</a>
    and read more about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document_Type_Declaration">what a doctype declaration is</a>.
