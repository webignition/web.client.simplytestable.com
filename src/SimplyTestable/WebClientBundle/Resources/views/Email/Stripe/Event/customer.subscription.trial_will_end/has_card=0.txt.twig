Hello!

The trial period for your {{plan_name}} account subscription ends in 3 days
after which you will be charged £{{plan_amount}} per month.

You need to add a credit or debit card to your account to continue using
the service:
{{account_url}}

You will receive another notification when your trial has ended. If you choose
not to add a credit or debit card to your account you will be downgraded to our
free plan at that time.
