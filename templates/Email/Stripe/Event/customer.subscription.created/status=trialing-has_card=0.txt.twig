Hello!

You've just signed up for our {{plan_name}} plan which you can enjoy free
for {{trial_period_days}} days (ending {{trial_end}}).

You'll need to add a credit or debit card to your account to continue using
the service beyond the trial. But don't worry for now, you'll get a reminder
3 days before your trial ends.

Let me know directly if you need any help or advice. I'm the founder, I'm in
a great position to help you out and I want to make your testing life easier.
