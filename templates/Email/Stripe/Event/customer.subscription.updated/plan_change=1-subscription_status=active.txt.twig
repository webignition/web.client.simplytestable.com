Hello!

You've switched to our {{new_plan}} plan at {{currency_symbol}}{{new_amount}} per month.

Here's how we handle the change in how much you are charged:

- your {{old_plan}} subscription will be pro-rata adjusted up until now
- your {{new_plan}} subscription will be pro-rata adjusted from now until
  the end of the month
- your next monthly invoice will include the pro-rata charge for
  your {{new_plan}} subscription in addition to the regular advance charge
  for your {{new_plan}} subscription

Let me know if this is not clear or if you have any questions.
