Hello!

I see you've chosen to drop back to our free basic plan during your premium
trial. That's ok, it's not for everyone.

You can upgrade again at any time to use the remaining {{trial_days_remaining}} day{{trial_days_remaining_pluralisation}} of your trial:
{{account_url}}

Is there anything you needed that we couldn't do for you? Let me know. I'm the
founder and can make things happen for you.
